Various implementations of my astronomical data service

These are the various implementations of my astronomical data service, which is mainly meant to be
used as a backend when I'm playing with various frontend technologies.

At the moment, there is only the typescript/mongodb implementation, but I'm not a huge mongodb
fan (Math.random anyone?), so I'll eventually get a postgress one in here.
